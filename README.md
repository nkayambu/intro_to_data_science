# intro_to_data_science
all assignments from intro to data science course

Assignment 1: 
  Nutritional Information of Fast Foods
  
  The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize yourself with how to filter data from an excel file using python and the pandas and numpy libraries.  
  
  
Assignment 2: 
  Data and Distribution of airport routes and movie votes.  
  
  The purpose for this assignment was for each dataset given, calculate different distributions (power law, exponential, uniform, normal) and plot them using 
  matplotlib and scipy.  For each of those find which distribution the data follows and support this conclusion using Q-Q plots of that data.  
  
  
Assignment 3: 
  Analysis of Youtube Comments
  
  The purpose of this assignment was to chose two youtube videos and create a word cloud of the comments of those videos and compare them.  How are they 
  similar or different.  The comments were obtained using the Youtube API.  
  
  
Assignment 4: 
  Pairwise Associations
  
  Dataset p1a.csv contains information of two genomic variants (matrix size 199x2) and using that data, find the mutual information, jaccard index, and 
  chi-squared to assess the association between the two genomic variants.  
  Datasets p2a.csv (2400x2), p2b.csv (110x2), and p2c.csv (2100x2).  Each column in these datasets represents a gene and the value represents the expression
  of the gene in different samples.  For each one the Pearson correlation is calculated to determine the association and the magnitude and direction of the 
  associations.  
  
  
Assignment 5: 
  Clustering
  
  The purpose of this assignment was to find the different clusters in two datasets and determine which k values were better for their k-means clusters.  
  The k-means algorithm and hierarchal clustering was applied to both datasets and compared.
